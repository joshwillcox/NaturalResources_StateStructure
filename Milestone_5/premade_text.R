                          correlation between the percentage of GDP that is 
                          from Tax Revenue and that which is from Natural 
                          Resources. While we cannot draw causal conclusions from
                          the data, it does show that countries which rely on
                          natural resources, are less likely to rely on tax
                          revenue"

about_p1 <- "For my project, I want to look at the effects that natural 
              resources/foreign aid can have on the strucutre of the state and
              its capacity. In one of my classes recently, we talked about how
              access to resources or foreign aid incentivises countries not to 
              develop a strong state. They prefer to not tax citizens and depend
              on other sources because then they do not have to provide benefits
              to the population. In the small graph I have made for this
              milestone, I have tried to see if there is any connection between 
              tax revenue as a  percentage of GDP and natural resource rents as 
              a percentage of GDP."

about_p2 <- "I still need to find a way to create the map of the world as the 
             data frame which I downloaded hasn't worked so far. I also want to
             create a tab that has a panel which lets me look at each country 
             and the factors within each country such as tax revenue as a 
             percentage of state revenue or natural resources. The map issue is 
             my biggest issue at the moment. This week, I created the seperate
             R file to put all my text and was able to bring in my graph without 
             copy and pasting from my changingdata.R file"
